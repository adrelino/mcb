# Data acquisition and annotation Tool
We introduce a web-based data acuisition and annotation tool for Mechanical Components. We collect models from online 3D CAD repositories [TraceParts](https://www.traceparts.com/), [3D WareHouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/), and [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/). To effectively annotate, CAD models are filtered and annotated using with this tools. We define classes by following the field ”Mechanical 290 Systems and Components” of the International Classification Standard (ICS).
